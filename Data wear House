A data warehouse is designed for querying and analysis rather than transaction processing.
The data in a data warehouse is organized around subject areas, such as customers, products, and sales, to support business analysis and reporting.
Data warehouses often use a dimensional data model, which organizes data around facts (such as sales) and dimensions (such as time, product, and geography).
A data warehouse can help organizations to integrate data from multiple sources and improve the quality and consistency of their data.
Data warehouses typically support online analytical processing (OLAP), which enables users to analyze data from different perspectives and dimensions.
Data warehouses often use Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes to extract data from source systems, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into the data warehouse.
Data warehouses can be implemented using a variety of technologies, such as relational databases, columnar databases, and Hadoop-based platforms.
